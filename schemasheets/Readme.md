# Schemasheets Directory Readme 

This directory is used to hold the [Schemasheets](https://linkml.io/schemasheets/) that can be used to build our YAML file. 

At the moment, it contains multiple sheets that are being edited manually to create a correct source of truth (SOT).

## Contents

As of 07 Feb 2023.
 * configs: holds configuration files that checks for bad names in the model
 * example_data/in
 * generated: the mixs schema generated by linkml from yaml files (yaml_out)
 * logs: logs, but what from?
 * multival_tabular_tests: Some kind of test
 * tsv_in: Schemasheets formatted tsv files used to generate the schema
 	* generated: 
 		* mixs_combination_classes: All possible combinations of checklists and extensions (aka environmental packages)
 		* mixs_problematic_enums: Values from enums that have some problem?
 	* originals: 
 		* complete
 			* MIxS_6_term_updates_MIxS6_Core-Final_clean.tsv: A copy of the same file listed directly below, but what has changed?
 		* MIxS_6_term_updates_MIxS6_packages-Final_clean.tsv: Taken from the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QDeeUcDqXes69Y2RjU2aWgOpCVWo5OVsBX9MKmMqi_o/edit#gid=178015749), but should have come from the [release in this repo](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/blob/main/mixs/excel/mixs_v6.xlsx)
 * utils: Python scripts for ...?
 * yaml_out: yaml file for linkml schema generated from schemasheet files (tsv_in)
 * __init__.py: Python script for ...?
 * mixs.db: ???

## Work in progress

See issues [529](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues/529) and [511](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/issues/511).

Currently working in [branch rlw_edit_02-2023](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/tree/rlw-edits-02-2023) which branches from [issue 511 branch](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/tree/issue-511-tested-schemasheets).

Ramona is working on the following tasks:
* Remove duplicate IDs for a label
* Remove multiple labels for an ID
* Mark which slots can have variant definitions per extension
* Make sure all the other slots have a single definition
* OUTCOME: Each and every slot (from MIxS 6 SOT) appears exactly once ...partial_slotdefs.tsv
* Also: Review classes in https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/blob/rlw-edits-02-2023/schemasheets/tsv_in/MIxS_6_term_updates_classdefs.tsv
* Also: Review slot assignments in https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/blob/rlw-edits-02-2023/schemasheets/tsv_in/MIxS_6_term_updates_slot_assignments_and_usages.tsv

## Next steps
* Confrim that the outcome is consistent with the [MIxS 6 SOT](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/blob/main/mixs/excel/mixs_v6.xlsx) just in case something was changed in the google doc.
* Check for any errors in the slotdefs. Is there a script for this task? Maybe [PR 524](https://github.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/pull/524).
* Rebuild schema (yaml file and generated files)
* ???
